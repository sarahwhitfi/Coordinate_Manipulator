# Coordinate_Manipulator
Inputs are in the form:
(your x coordinate) (your y coordinate) (# of locations) (# of points to search for) (threshold to determine whether Merge or Insertion Sort is used)
Then there should be a list of each location's coordinates each on a new line.
Finally, there should be a list of all the points to search for.

The program will let you know if the coordinate contains a location and how far it is relative to the other coordinates.
